@deftypefun {ASN1_TYPE} {asn1_find_node} (ASN1_TYPE @var{pointer}, const char * @var{name})
@var{pointer}: NODE_ASN element pointer.

@var{name}: null terminated string with the element's name to find.

Searches for an element called NAME starting from POINTER.  The
name is composed by differents identifiers separated by dots.  When
*POINTER has a name, the first identifier must be the name of
*POINTER, otherwise it must be the name of one child of *POINTER.

@strong{Return value:} the searching result. NULL if not found.

@deftypefun {const char *} {asn1_check_version} (const char * @var{req_version})
@var{req_version}: Required version number, or NULL.

Check that the version of the library is at minimum the
requested one and return the version string; return @code{NULL} if the
condition is not satisfied.  If a @code{NULL} is passed to this function,
no check is done, but the version string is simply returned.

See @code{ASN1_VERSION} for a suitable @code{req_version} string.

@strong{Return value:} Version string of run-time library, or @code{NULL} if the
run-time library does not meet the required version number.
