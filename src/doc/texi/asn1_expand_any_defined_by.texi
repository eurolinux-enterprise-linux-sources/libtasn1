@var{definitions}: ASN1 definitions

@var{element}: pointer to an ASN1 structure

Expands every "ANY DEFINED BY" element of a structure created from
a DER decoding process (asn1_der_decoding function). The element ANY
must be defined by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER. The type used to expand
the element ANY is the first one following the definition of
the actual value of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

@strong{Returns:} 
@strong{ASN1_SUCCESS:} Substitution OK.

@strong{ASN1_ERROR_TYPE_ANY:} Some "ANY DEFINED BY" element couldn't be
expanded due to a problem in OBJECT_ID -> TYPE association.

other errors: Result of der decoding process.
