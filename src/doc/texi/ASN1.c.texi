@deftypefun {asn1_retCode} {asn1_parser2tree} (const char * @var{file_name}, ASN1_TYPE * @var{definitions}, char * @var{errorDescription})
@var{file_name}: specify the path and the name of file that contains
ASN.1 declarations.

@var{definitions}: return the pointer to the structure created from
"file_name" ASN.1 declarations.

@var{errorDescription}: return the error description or an empty
string if success.

Creates the structures needed to manage the definitions included
in *FILE_NAME file.

@strong{Returns:} 
@strong{ASN1_SUCCESS:} The file has a correct syntax and every identifier
is known.

@strong{ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_EMPTY:} *POINTER not ASN1_TYPE_EMPTY.

@strong{ASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND:} An error occured while opening FILE_NAME.

@strong{ASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR:} The syntax is not correct.

@strong{ASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND:} In the file there is an identifier that
is not defined.

@strong{ASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG:} In the file there is an identifier whith more
than ASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE characters.

@deftypefun {int} {asn1_parser2array} (const char * @var{inputFileName}, const char * @var{outputFileName}, const char * @var{vectorName}, char * @var{errorDescription})
@var{inputFileName}: specify the path and the name of file that
contains ASN.1 declarations.

@var{outputFileName}: specify the path and the name of file that will
contain the C vector definition.

@var{vectorName}: specify the name of the C vector.

@var{errorDescription}: return the error description or an empty
string if success.

Creates a file containing a C vector to use to manage the
definitions included in *INPUTFILENAME file. If *INPUTFILENAME is
"/aa/bb/xx.yy" and OUTPUTFILENAME is NULL, the file created is
"/aa/bb/xx_asn1_tab.c".  If VECTORNAME is NULL the vector name
will be "xx_asn1_tab".

@strong{Returns:} 
@strong{ASN1_SUCCESS:} The file has a correct syntax and every identifier
is known.

@strong{ASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND:} An error occured while opening FILE_NAME.

@strong{ASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR:} The syntax is not correct.

@strong{ASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND:} In the file there is an identifier that
is not defined.

@strong{ASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG:} In the file there is an identifier whith more
than ASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE characters.
